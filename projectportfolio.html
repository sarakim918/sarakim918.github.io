        <h3>SK Planner</h3>
        <p><em>SK Planner</em> was a solo project I developed for MacOS in Xcode during a graduate seminar class. As my final project, I created a comprehensive planner app that prioritizes data consistency across various panels, user intuitiveness, and customizability to suit diverse needs. Throughout this project, I gained invaluable experience in Swift, UI design, macOS development, Xcode, and data flow management. This project was a significant milestone in my development journey and stands out as my favorite project to date. A demo video showcasing basic app functionality is available to the left, and the source code can be found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/sarakim918/SKPlanner">here.</a></p>

        <h3>Soletta</h3>
        <p><em>Soletta</em> was another graduate seminar project. I partnered with a classmate over the course of the semester to create an original desktop video game using GameMaker Studio. Soletta is a fun and lighthearted space-themed adventure game that offered a diverse range of gameplay modes, including enemy combat, puzzle-solving, and spaceship navigation. Working on this project significantly deepened my understanding of object-oriented programming, game mechanics, graphics, player engagement, and user testing. A demo video showcasing the game can be found to the right, but unfortunately I am unable to share the code as it would not be appropriate to distribute it without my partner's consent.</p>

        <h3>Spanish Is Fun</h3>
        <p><em>Spanish is Fun</em> was a 6-week summer project focused on creating a mobile application for a local Spanish school. Developed for both iOS and Android platforms using Flutter, Xcode, and Android Studio, our team of three undergraduate students aimed to enhance the language learning experience through engaging exercises and interactive features. The app offered a variety of functionality, including flashcards, multiple-choice quizzes, and audio-visual aids for pronunciation practice. Our team also prioritized aesthetics and user experience, investing significant effort into design elements such as splash screens, logos, and visual content. The emphasis on quality permeated every aspect of the project, resulting in a polished and user-friendly application. The project's code remains under contract, so unfortunately there is no access.</p>

        <h3>Clue</h3>
        <p><em>Clue</em> was an undergraduate project developed over using Java and the Agile development process. I collaborated with a partner to create a desktop version of the classic board game, Clue. This project marked my first significant software programming endeavor, providing invaluable lessons in data structures, data management, code organization, pair programming, graphics, and user interfaces. Designed as a single-player game, we faced the additional challenge of integrating computer-generated player moves through complex algorithms, adding depth and realism to the gameplay. This project was both challenging and rewarding, and significantly enhanced my programming and development skills. A demo video showcasing the gameplay can be found to the right. I am again unable to share the code as it would not be appropriate to distribute it without my partner's consent.</p>

        <h3>Promoting Social Health for International Students</h3>
        <p><em>Promoting Social Health for International Students: A Human-Centered Design
          Approach to Support In-Situ Social Training, Reflection, and Connection</em> was an on-campus research project I conducted with three other graduate students that focused on the unique challenges faced by international students. Leveraging social and collaborative computing values and human-centered design techniques, we aimed to understand and address the unique social health needs of this group. Our methodology included questionnaires, interviews, and user testing sessions, which allowed us to uncover problems, specify design implications, generate potential solutions, and develop a prototype application guided by our interviewees. The project details and findings are thoroughly documented in the paper to the left.</p>

        <h3>Hey Siri, Who's Listening?</h3>
        <p><em>Hey Siri, Who's Listening?</em> was a solo research project I completed for a graduate seminar on Privacy and Security in Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This project focused on the Siri voice activation function found in most Apple devices. Through comprehensive at-home testing, I aimed to identify the frequency of accidental activations and examine the privacy implications of such behavior. The research revealed suspicious inconsistencies in Siri's behavior, particularly when comparing device responses in active mode versus sleep mode. These findings highlight potential privacy concerns related to unintended activations and data collection practices. The full project details, including methodology and results, are documented in the paper to the right.</p>
